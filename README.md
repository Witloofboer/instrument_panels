# Glider instrument panels #

This repo contains instrument panels for different glider types. The goal is to continously add multiple layouts for different glider types. At the moment, every glider type has its own folder.

The files are either made with Autodesk Inventor where possible, but sometimes Autodesk Fusion 360 was/is the easiest option. In the latter case, only .dxf files are available.

The gliders included for now are:
* Centrair Pegase C101
* Schempp-Hirth Standard Cirrus (75 B)
